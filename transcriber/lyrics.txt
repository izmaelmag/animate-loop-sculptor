Sound it keeps on playing like it's on and on
And music is religion and the gods' song
People keep on moving and they sing along
This feeling is a heaven where we all belong
Forget discrimination 'cause we're made of the same
Everybody's loving ain't no time to make names
Oh, we got the feeling and forever remain
Flying altogether on an orbital plane

We wanna make love, we wanna get high
We wanna make love, we wanna get high
We wanna make love, we wanna get high
We wanna make love
